If you want to see Cedar in action, implement Cedar as a service, or work with an example application while you learn, check out these additional resources.

+ Build policies and experiment with Cedar authorization with the [Cedar playground](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en/playground).
+ Set up an example application with [cedar-examples on GitHub](https://github.com/cedar-policy/cedar-examples/). For an example that doubles as a beginning tutorial, start with [tinytodo](https://github.com/cedar-policy/cedar-examples/tree/release/3.2.x/tinytodo).
+ Create a managed Cedar policy store with [Amazon Verified Permissions](https://aws.amazon.com/verified-permissions/).
+ Join the [cedar-policy Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/cedar-policy/cedar-policy-language).
